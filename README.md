# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio**.  
This repository showcases hands-on projects I have completed across multiple areas of cybersecurity, demonstrating practical skills in penetration testing, network security, web application security, system hardening, social engineering, and advanced exploit development.  

Each project is organized by **security domain** to highlight a professional skill-based portfolio.
